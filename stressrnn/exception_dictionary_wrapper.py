class ExceptionDictWrapper:
    ''' Exception dictionary for correcting stress placement. Contains methods:
    - is_in_dict(): checking if a word is in the dictionary
    - put_stress(): placing stress in a word in accordance with the dictionary

    The exception dictionary must contain a list of words with stresses placed in them using the "'" or '+' symbol after the vowel
    (1 line = 1 word).

    The dictionary looks like this:
        дре+гер
        ивано+в
        ...

    The main dictionary comes with the package and is located in 'stressrnn/exception_dictionary.txt'. You can also add your own
    dictionary, the values from which will complement the main dictionary (and overwrite the same words, but with different stresses).
